# Git cheatsheet

> My personal Git cheatsheet.

## Editing

### Edit last local commit message

`git commit --amend --only -m 'A new message that will override the original message.'`

### Move changes from one branch to another

`git checkout target_branch path/to/file/relative/to/current/location.cs`

## Reverting

### Revert last commit (keep changes)

`git reset HEAD~1`

### Revert last commit (discard changes)

`git reset --hard HEAD~1`

### Wipe everything (discard all changes and modifications, files)

`git reset â€“hard && git clean -fxd`

## Stashing (Temporary Storage of Changes)

### Stash changes for later

`git stash save "Description of changes"`

### Apply stashed changes

`git stash apply stash@{n}`

### List stashes

`git stash list`

## Data collection

### Different files between two branches

`git checkout source_branch; git diff target_branch --name-only`

## Feature branch split for smaller PR

```git
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout -b new_branch_for_pull_request
git checkout feature_branch_with_all_changes src/path/to/file.cs
git checkout feature_branch_with_all_changes src/path/to/anotherfile.cs
```

## How to write a good commit message

* Separate subject from body with a blank line.
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
* Capitalize the subject line.
* Do not end the subject line with a period.
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line, see below.
* Wrap the body at 72 characters.
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.

An imperative mood is when you do not use past tense or similar. You basically fill up this template: *If applied, this commit will* **your subject line**.

Limits for 50/72 characters are soft limits. I personally don't like the latter limit because there is no technical reason for that. It's just derived from [IBM punch cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card) which had 72+8 characters per line.

If you can't fit into 50 characters for a subject line, divide changes into multiple commits. Same advice apply when you have a tendency to use *and* in your subject line.

### Rebase

Maintains a linear history.
